# Line-follower-PID_16-Sensors_I2C-Protocol-

This is a personal project that i made for college assignment, i make a Line-Follower robot with spesific feature.
- Implementing 16 Sensors (Photodiode, resistor, and led)
- PID calculation to help robot run smoothly, and recogize obstacle route and intersection.
- Multiplexer x16 Modul for arduino atmega 328
